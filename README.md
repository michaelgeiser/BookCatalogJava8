### Book
1. The `@Entity` annotation marks this class as a JPA entity, which means it will be mapped to a database table.
2. The `@Id` annotation marks the `id` field as the primary key of the entity.
3. The `@GeneratedValue` annotation with the strategy `GenerationType.AUTO` tells JPA to automatically generate the primary key values.
4. We've defined the properties `title`, `author`, `publicationDate`, and `isbn` to represent the book's details.
5. We've added a default constructor (required by JPA).
6. We've provided getter and setter methods for all properties.

With this `Book` class, we've defined the data model for our book management system. In the next step, we'll create a repository to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on the `Book` entity.

### Book Management System Application
This class is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, which is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

- `@Configuration`: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
- `@ComponentScan`: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the `com/example` package.

The `main` method uses `SpringApplication.run()` to launch the Spring Boot application.

Note: Since we've added the `BookManagementSystemApplication` class as the entry point for our Spring Boot application, you no longer need to run the application using the `java -cp` command. Instead, you can use the `mvn spring-boot:run` command to start the application locally during development.

### Book Repository
- We've defined an interface named `BookRepository` that extends `JpaRepository<Book, Long>`.
- The `JpaRepository` is a Spring Data JPA interface that provides a set of built-in methods for performing CRUD operations on the `Book` entity.
- The `Book` parameter specifies the entity type, and `Long` is the type of the primary key (`id` field in the `Book` class).
- The `@Repository` annotation is a marker for any class that fulfills the responsibilities of a repository pattern.

By extending `JpaRepository`, the `BookRepository` interface inherits several methods for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting `Book` entities. These methods include:

- `findAll()`: Retrieve all instances of the entity type.
- `findById(Long id)`: Retrieve an entity instance by its primary key.
- `save(Book book)`: Save a new or existing entity.
- `deleteById(Long id)`: Delete an entity by its primary key.
- And many more methods for advanced querying and pagination.

You can also define custom query methods in this interface if needed, following the naming conventions defined by Spring Data JPA.

### Book Controller
- We've created a `BookController` class annotated with `@RestController`, indicating that this class will handle RESTful API requests.
- We've added the `@RequestMapping("/api/books")` annotation to map all the endpoints to the `/api/books` base URL.
- We've injected the `BookService` instance using constructor-based dependency injection.
- We've defined the following endpoints:
    - `@PostMapping`: Maps to the `/api/books` URL for creating a new book. It accepts a `Book` object in the request body and delegates the creation to the `bookService.saveBook()` method.
    - `@GetMapping`: Maps to the `/api/books` URL for retrieving all books. It delegates the retrieval to the `bookService.getAllBooks()` method.
    - `@GetMapping("/{id}")`: Maps to the `/api/books/{id}` URL for retrieving a book by its ID. It delegates the retrieval to the `bookService.getBookById()` method.
    - `@DeleteMapping("/{id}")`: Maps to the `/api/books/{id}` URL for deleting a book by its ID. It delegates the deletion to the `bookService.deleteBook()` method.
- Each endpoint method returns a `ResponseEntity` with the appropriate HTTP status code and response body.

With the `BookController` in place, you now have a RESTful API for managing books. You can access the following endpoints:

- `POST /api/books`: Create a new book
- `GET /api/books`: Retrieve all books
- `GET /api/books/{id}`: Retrieve a book by its ID
- `DELETE /api/books/{id}`: Delete a book by its ID

### Database
Created and added properties to the `application.properties` file:

- `spring.datasource.url`: Specifies the JDBC URL for the H2 in-memory database. `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` creates a new in-memory database named "testdb" every time the application starts.
- `spring.datasource.driverClassName`: Specifies the fully qualified name of the JDBC driver class for H2.
- `spring.datasource.username` and `spring.datasource.password`: Specifies the username and password for the H2 database (in this case, the default username is "sa" with no password).
- `spring.jpa.database-platform`: Specifies the Hibernate dialect for the H2 database.
- `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop`: Tells Hibernate to create the database schema automatically based on the entities and drop the schema when the application stops. This is useful for development and testing purposes.
- `spring.h2.console.enabled=true`: Enables the H2 Console, a web-based UI for interacting with the H2 database.

With these properties configured, Spring Boot will automatically create an in-memory H2 database and manage the database schema based on your entity classes (in this case, the `Book` entity).

When you run the application, you can access the H2 Console by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/h2-console` in your web browser. In the H2 Console, you can enter the JDBC URL (`jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`), username (`sa`), and leave the password field blank to connect to the in-memory database.

From the H2 Console, you can execute SQL queries, view the database schema, and perform other database operations as needed during development and testing.

### Example usage
Here are some examples of cURL commands you can use to test the book management API:

1. **Create a new book**

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Book Title","author":"Author Name","publicationDate":"2022-05-01","isbn":"978-1234567890"}' http://localhost:8080/api/books
```

This command sends a POST request to the `/api/books` endpoint with the book details in the request body. If the book is created successfully, you should receive a response with the newly created book object and a status code of 201 (Created).

2. **Retrieve all books**

```
curl http://localhost:8080/api/books
```

This command sends a GET request to the `/api/books` endpoint and should return a JSON array of all the books in the database.

3. **Retrieve a book by ID**

```
curl http://localhost:8080/api/books/1
```

This command sends a GET request to the `/api/books/1` endpoint, where `1` is the ID of the book you want to retrieve. If the book exists, you should receive a response with the book object; otherwise, you'll get a 404 (Not Found) error.

4. **Update a book**

```
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id":1,"title":"Updated Title","author":"Author Name","publicationDate":"2022-06-01","isbn":"978-9876543210"}' http://localhost:8080/api/books/1
```

This command sends a PUT request to the `/api/books/1` endpoint with the updated book details in the request body. If the book with the specified ID exists, it will be updated with the new details.

5. **Delete a book**

```
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/books/1
```

This command sends a DELETE request to the `/api/books/1` endpoint, where `1` is the ID of the book you want to delete. If the book exists, it will be removed from the database.
